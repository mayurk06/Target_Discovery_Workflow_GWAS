# Target_Discovery_Workflow_GWAS
This repository contains the work from my summer 2022 internship project. It contains a mix of bash and python scripts and some nextflow pipelines. Due to time constraints, some workflows have been integrated into a pipeline, while others need to be run individually.

# Repo Structure
This repo contains 2 main folders. 

## 22_Project 
Contains the "raw" files used to carry out the exact work of my internship. All the files within 22_Project can stil be used in other workflows, but will just require additional work from the user to update values according to their data files.

## Pipeline_GWAS 
Contains the in progress pipeline work for reproducible workflows. 

# TODO
1. Integrate remaining individual workflow files into the nextflow pipeline.
2. Refactor code to allow for flexibility of inputs/outputs
