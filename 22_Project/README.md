# 22_Project
This folder contains the ad-hoc scripts used to perform my kidney disease target project of summer 2022. The overall flow of the work is to extract GWAS index loci, run conditional regression to extract additional loci, integrate QTL signals, collect data for colocalization algorithms, and run the HyprCOLOC algorithm.
